Hello, the included applet relies on the python cryptography library being installed on the system via pip install cryptography or other similar command.
The program will allow user input in the first text box which can then be encrypted. Output goes to the output text box in addition to automatically
filling the input text box. A key is generated upon the application being opened but can also be regenerated.
